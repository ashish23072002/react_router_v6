## Why React Router?

Single-Page Application (SPA) Navigation: Allows you to navigate between different "pages" (components) without full page reloads, making your app feel faster and more fluid.

Declarative Routing: Define your routes as React components, making them easy to read and manage.

URL Management: Synchronizes your UI with the URL, allowing users to bookmark pages and use the browser's back/forward buttons.

Nested Routing: Supports complex UIs where parts of the layout change based on nested URLs.

## Outlet

In React Router DOM, the <Outlet /> component serves as a placeholder within a parent route's component where the matched child route components will be rendered. It is a key element for implementing nested routing and shared layouts.
